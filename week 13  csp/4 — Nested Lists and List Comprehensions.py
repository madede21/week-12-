# Key Notes:

# A list can contain other lists.

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Examples:

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print(matrix[1][2])    # 6

# List comprehension
first_col = [row[0] for row in matrix]
print(first_col)       # [1, 4, 7]



# Practice Problems:

# Build a matrix variable containing 3 lists of 3 numbers each.
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Print the first list.
print(matrix[0])
# Print the second item from the third list.

# Use a list comprehension to extract the last item from each sub-list.

# Challenge: Create a new list containing squares of numbers from 1–10 using a comprehension.


squares = [x**2 for x in range (1,11)]
print(squares)
